## This is the file repository for my **Assignment B1** for **STATS 545B**:
- Author: Jaden L. Phillips
- Date: November 2022


### This folder contains:
- a **Assignment_B1_jlp.Rmd** file: where the main body of code for this milestone was written. It details the function I built, its documentation, examples, and formal tests of the function.
- a **Assignment_B1_jlp.md** file: the knitted Markdown output document (GitHub viewer-friendly)
- the **asgmt.b1.b2-jlp.Rproj** file, though not strictly necessary to run my code from the .rmd and .md files, can be useful if one were to try and replicate/ reproduce the entire project that I created from scratch
- a *folder for figures* generated within the code
- a **.gitignore** file that tells Git which files to ignore when committing my project to the GitHub repository
- this **README.md** file


### The purpose of this Assignment #B1 is to:
- Familiarize ourselves with syntax & operation of R functions in order to **create our own fucntion**
   - I.e., to make a novel function
- To **document** our new function using roxygen2 tags (via Insert Roxygen Skeleton)
- To **provide examples** of how our function does and/or does not work
- Last but not least, to **test run our functions**: do they operate the way they are supposed to, do they throw informative errors to users when used incorrectly, etc.
    - Wrtie a number of formal tests for the function
    - Using various expect_() functions from the testthat package 

### How can this code in the GitHub repository be run?
- ANS: The code that appears in my project folder here on the GitHub repository can be run in RStudio.
